# HostShield
HostShield is a simple Windows tool that protects your computer by adding a list of malicious domains and IPs (botnets, malware, IP loggers, trackers, RATs) into the hosts file so they can not connect. It updates automatically and runs on startup.

**Note:** This should not be used as an actual AV solution, just an extra layer of protection. Many rats go undetected by AVs, so blocking known endpoints helps.

## Contributing  
Anyone can submit a pull request to add more malicious domains or IPs, or to improve the program.
